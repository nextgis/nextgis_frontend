# NGW Types Loader

![size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@nextgis/ngw-types-loader) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nextgis/ngw-types-loader)

A CLI tool to download and manage TypeScript declaration files for NextGIS Web applications.

- Downloads TypeScript declaration files from the NGW API.
- Automatically updates `tsconfig.json` with the new declaration file.
- Configurable API URL for custom NGW deployments.

## Installation

### In Node.js

```bash
npm install @nextgis/ngw-types-loader
```

## Usage

You can use the CLI tool directly in your project. By default, it downloads the declaration file from `https://demo.nextgis.com` and updates `tsconfig.json` to include the declaration file.

### CLI

```bash
ngw-types-loader
```

This command will:

- Download the TypeScript declaration file.
- Prompt you to automatically update `tsconfig.json` with the new declaration file.

If you are using a custom NGW deployment, you can provide a custom domain:

```bash
ngw-types-loader https://custom-domain.com
```

### Default URL (`demo.nextgis.com`)

By default, `ngw-types-loader` downloads the declaration file from `https://demo.nextgis.com`. This domain always contains the most up-to-date version of the TypeScript types for NextGIS Web.

- **If your NextGIS Web instance is hosted in the NextGIS Cloud**, the types from `demo.nextgis.com` will fully match your instance, so you may not need to change the URL.
- **If you are hosting NextGIS Web on your own server**, it's recommended to use the types generated by your own server to ensure compatibility with your specific setup.

In the case of self-hosted NGW, you should point the loader to your server's API:

```bash
ngw-types-loader https://your-ngw-server.com
```

### Example

1. Run the following command to download the declaration file:

   ```bash
   ngw-types-loader
   ```

2. After downloading, the tool will prompt you to update your `tsconfig.json`. If you agree, it will automatically add the declaration file to the `"include"` section:

   ```json
   {
     "include": [
       "./nextgisweb.d.ts"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. If you choose not to update `tsconfig.json`, you will need to manually add the declaration file to the `"include"` section.

### API Documentation

This tool interacts with the NGW API to fetch TypeScript declaration files. Check out the [API Documentation](https://demo.nextgis.com/doc/api).

This version explains the default use of `demo.nextgis.com` and when itâ€™s appropriate to use your own NGW server for type declarations. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
