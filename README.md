## Base usage

### Using directly in the browser

#### Include assets

Download and include with a script tag. \[Package\] will be registered as a global variable.

```html
<script src="./lib/[package].js"></script>
<script>
  var package = new Package(options);
</script>
```

#### CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@nextgis/[package]@latest"></script>
```

We recommend linking to a specific version number that you can update manually:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@nextgis/[package]@0.4.0"></script>
```

### NPM/YARN

NPM/YARN is the recommended installation method when building large scale applications with [PACKAGE]. It pairs nicely with module bundlers such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

```bash
# latest stable
$ npm i -S @nextgis/[package]
# or with yarn
$ yarn add @nextgis/[package]
```

then import the \[package\] in the project modules

```js
import Package from '@nextgis/[package]';

const package = new Package(options);
```

## For developers

### Instructions for whole repository

```bash
# Clone git through ssh
git clone git@github.com:nextgis/nextgisweb_frontend.git
cd ./nextgisweb_frontend
# Install yarn and lerna global
npm i -g yarn lerna
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Prepare packages
yarn run bootstrap
# Build all packages
yarn run prod
# Build demp app
yarn run demo
```

### Instructions for a particular package

```bash
# Go to package directory (for example webmap)
cd ./packages/webmap
# Run build command
yarn run build
# Run watch source files changes command
yarn run watch
```

### Publishing

To publish new version to git and npm run

```bash
lerna publish
```

When publishing, you will need to select a new version number. It is the same for all libraries.
Dependencies between packages are solved automatically.

To publish a new package, run the following command in the package folder

```bash
npm publish --access=public
```

### Troubleshoot

Sometimes there are problems of establishing dependencies between libraries.
For example, between the ngw-kit and the ngw-connector.
In this case, you need to execute commands from root directory

```bash
rm -rf ./node_modules
# or
del ./node_modules # for Windows
lerna clean
lerna bootstrap
```

---

Currently an error may occur if the git is connected via http[s] instead of ssh.

VSCode

[Bug](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25312) When not finding symbolic linked modules try:

1. `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `P` or equivalent for MacOS (brings up the command palette)
2. Search something like "typescript"
3. Select TypeScript: Restart TS server

---

### Might be of help
